## 1. Project Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

*   `scripts/`: Contains the main `benchmark.py` program and the C implementations of the sorting algorithms.
*   `test_data/`: Stores pre-generated input data files used for benchmarking.
*   `executables/`: (Generated during runtime) Stores compiled C executables of the sorting algorithms.
*   `graphs/`: (Generated during runtime) Contains CSV files with benchmarking results and plots produced by the Python scripts.
*   `REPORT.md`: The final report detailing the experimental setup and analysis.

## 2. Algorithms Benchmarked

The benchmarking process includes the following five sorting algorithms, chosen to represent different categories:

1.  **Simple Comparison-Based Sort:** Bubble Sort
2.  **Efficient Comparison-Based Sort:** Quicksort (using the last element as pivot)
3.  **Non-Comparison Sort:** Radix Sort
4.  **Other Sorting Algorithm 1:** Selection Sort
5.  **Other Sorting Algorithm 2:** Insertion Sort

## 3. Benchmarking Methodology

The experimental setup is designed to provide stable and comparable performance measurements for the selected sorting algorithms.

### 3.1. Machine Specifications

*   **Operating System:** Windows
*   **Model:** ASUS Vivobook 16X
*   **Processor:** Intel i7
*   **Graphics Card:** NVIDIA RTX 4050 Studio
*   **Serial Number:** R6N0CX02K537230

### 3.2. Timing Mechanism

The execution time for each sorting algorithm is measured using **Python's `time.perf_counter()`**. This function provides a high-resolution performance counter, suitable for benchmarking short durations. The C sorting programs are executed as subprocesses, and their total execution time (including input reading, sorting, and any internal overhead) is captured by the Python script.

### 3.3. Number of Experiment Repetitions

Each sorting experiment (a specific algorithm run on a particular input size and type) is repeated **7 times**. The purpose of multiple repetitions is to minimize the impact of transient system loads, background processes, and other environmental factors that could introduce variability in single measurements.

### 3.4. Reported Times

For each experiment, the **average execution time** across the 7 repetitions is reported. Times are presented in **seconds (s)**, formatted to six decimal places for precision. In cases where an algorithm fails to complete (e.g., due to stack overflow for certain Quick Sort variants on large, pathological inputs), "Crashed/Timeout" is reported.

### 3.5. Input Selection

The test data used for benchmarking is pre-generated by the `generate_test_data.py` script. The inputs are selected to cover a range of sizes and initial orderings to evaluate best-case, worst-case, and average-case performance:

*   **Input Sizes (N):** The following input sizes are tested: 100, 500, 1,000, 5,000, 10,000, 25,000, 50,000, 75,000, and 100,000 elements.
*   **Input Types:** For each input size, three distinct types of data are generated:
    *   **Random:** A randomly ordered array of integers. This serves to evaluate the **average-case** performance of the algorithms.
    *   **Sorted:** An array of integers already sorted in ascending order. This is used to evaluate **best-case** performance for some algorithms (e.g., Insertion Sort, Merge Sort) and **worst-case** performance for others (e.g., Quick Sort with naive pivot selection).
    *   **Reverse Sorted:** An array of integers sorted in descending order. This typically represents a **worst-case** scenario for many comparison-based sorting algorithms.

### 3.6. Consistency of Inputs

The exact same set of input data files is used for all sorting algorithms. This ensures a fair and direct comparison of their performance characteristics under identical conditions. Each C sorting program is modified to read its input from standard input (stdin), allowing the Python benchmarking script to feed the exact same data to each algorithm.

## 4. Sorting Algorithms Details

### Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.

#### Properties

Data structure: Array

| Performance                 | Comparison                                      |
| :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| Worst-case performance      | O(n^2) comparisons, O(n^2) swaps                |
| Best-case performance       | O(n) comparisons, O(1) swaps (already sorted)   |
| Average performance         | O(n^2) comparisons, O(n^2) swaps                |
| Worst-case space complexity | O(1) auxiliary                                  |

### Selection Sort

The algorithm divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of the list. Initially, the sorted sublist is empty and the unsorted sublist is the entire input list. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging (swapping) it with the leftmost unsorted element (putting it in sorted order), and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.

#### Properties

Data structure: Array

| Performance                 | Comparison                    |
| :-------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| Worst-case performance      | O(n^2) comparisons, O(n) swaps |
| Best-case performance       | O(n^2) comparisons, O(n) swaps |
| Average performance         | O(n^2) comparisons, O(n) swaps |
| Worst-case space complexity | O(1) auxiliary                |

### Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. However, it has several advantages: simple implementation, efficient for small data sets, and efficient for data sets that are already substantially sorted.

#### Properties

Data structure: Array

| Performance                 | Comparison                                      |
| :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| Worst-case performance      | O(n^2) comparisons, O(n^2) shifts               |
| Best-case performance       | O(n) comparisons, O(1) shifts (already sorted)  |
| Average performance         | O(n^2) comparisons, O(n^2) shifts               |
| Worst-case space complexity | O(1) auxiliary                                  |

### Merge Sort

Merge Sort is an efficient, comparison-based, divide and conquer sorting algorithm. It works by dividing an unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted). Then, it repeatedly merges sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sorted sublist remaining.

#### Properties

Data structure: Array (typically implemented with arrays, but can be linked lists)

| Performance                 | Comparison                                      |
| :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| Worst-case performance      | O(n log n)                                      |
| Best-case performance       | O(n log n)                                      |
| Average performance         | O(n log n)                                      |
| Worst-case space complexity | O(n) auxiliary (for array implementations)      |

### Quicksort

Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. This particular implementation uses the **last element as the pivot**. This can be done in-place, requiring small additional amounts of memory to perform the sorting.

| Performance                 | Comparison                                      |
| :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| Worst-case performance      | O(n^2) (e.g., with sorted/reverse-sorted input and naive pivot) |
| Best-case performance       | O(n log n)                                      |
| Average performance         | O(n log n)                                      |
| Worst-case space complexity | O(log n) auxiliary (for recursion stack)        |

### Radix Sort

Radix sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm. It avoids comparison by creating and distributing elements into buckets according to their radix (base). For elements with more than one significant digit, this bucketing process is repeated for each digit, while preserving the ordering of the prior step, until all digits have been considered. For this reason, radix sort has a time complexity of O(nk), where n is the number of elements and k is the number of digits (or passes).

| :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| Worst-case performance      | O(nk)                                           |
| Best-case performance       | O(nk)                                           |
| Average performance         | O(nk)                                           |
| Worst-case space complexity | O(n + k) auxiliary (depending on bucket implementation) |
